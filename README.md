# Sorting_Algorithm Repository

## Resources:
- Sorting algorithm
- Big O notation
- Sorting algorithms animations
- 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
- CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan
- All about sorting algorithms

## Learning Objectives:
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General:
- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms
- Understand the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- Learn how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Understand what makes a sorting algorithm stable

## Description:
This repository serves as a learning resource for sorting algorithms. It includes implementations of at least four different sorting algorithms in C, following the Betty coding style guidelines. The provided resources cover fundamental concepts such as sorting algorithms, Big O notation, and their visualizations. The learning objectives encourage a deeper understanding of algorithmic efficiency, helping users select the most appropriate sorting algorithm for specific scenarios. The repository aims to enhance comprehension through code examples and informative comments.

Feel free to explore the code examples and educational materials to deepen your understanding of sorting algorithms and algorithmic efficiency.
